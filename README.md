# VTK-scripts-for-CBCL
This is a repository for VTK/VTK-python scripts you feel would be useful for the lab. 

Please upload your scripts with:
* a title that indicates the basic use case of the script; 
* any run-time instructions such as i/o formats, dependencies on other libraries, etc;
* suitable comments at different parts of the code.
* any example input files that you may have (make a separate folder with the script name)
